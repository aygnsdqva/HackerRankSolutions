Jesse loves cookies and wants the sweetness of some cookies to be greater than value k . To do this, two cookies
with the least sweetness are repeatedly mixed. This creates a special combined cookie with:

sweetness=( 1  * Least sweet cookie + 2 * 2nd least sweet cookie).

This occurs until all the cookies have a sweetness >=k.

Given the sweetness of a number of cookies, determine the minimum number of operations required. If it is not possible, return -1.
