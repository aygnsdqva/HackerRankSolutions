Given an array of n distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements.
A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first k elements in the sequence are in increasing order
and the last k elements are in decreasing order, where k=(n+1)/2. You need to find the lexicographically smallest
zig zag sequence of the given array.
example

Input:
1 7
1 3 2 4 5 6 7

 Output:
1 2 3 7 6 5 4
